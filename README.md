📌 Geldium Delinquency Prediction – AI/ML Project
🔍 AI-driven Financial Risk Prediction & Responsible Collections Strategy

This repository contains my complete end-to-end project for predicting customer delinquency using machine learning and designing an AI-powered collections system.
This project was completed as part of the Geldium GenAI Case Challenge.

📁 Project Overview

The goal of the project is to build a predictive model that identifies customers likely to become delinquent (miss payments).
The project also includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model development using ML

Confusion matrix & ROC curve

Business storytelling

Responsible AI recommendations

A high-level autonomous AI collections system design

🧠 Objectives

Predict customer delinquency using ML algorithms

Identify key risk drivers

Develop actionable business recommendations

Ensure fairness and responsible AI practices

Design a scalable AI-powered debt-collection system

📊 Tech Stack
